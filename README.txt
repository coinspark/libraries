CoinSpark libraries README - coinspark.org


ABOUT
-----
The CoinSpark libraries help you integrate support for the CoinSpark protocol into
your wallet, or any other tool or service.

The libraries are available in 5 languages:

* C/C++
* Java
* Javascript
* PHP (5+)
* Python (2.5+, 3+)

The libraries for each language are functionally identical, and use as similar
calling conventions as possible, given the constraints imposed by each language. 

For more information and code examples: http://coinspark.org/developers/


HOW TO TEST
-----------
The libraries include extensive tests to verify that it behaves identically for
all inputs, for all languages. We encourage you to run these tests for yourself
by following the steps below. Explicit command line instructions are provided
for Unix-based systems.

* Download all the library files to your computer.

* In your Terminal, navigate to the directory containing those files

* Compile the C library tests:

gcc -o c/coinspark-test c/*.c -lm

* Run the executable:

c/coinspark-test

* Keep pressing return to accept all default options displayed.

* If no error is shown, the library has passed all internal C tests.

* Navigate to the directory containing the test files

cd CoinSpark-Tests-*

* For each '...-Input.txt' file, run the PHP test on that input:

php ../php/coinspark-test.php Address-Input.txt > Address-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php AssetRef-Input.txt > AssetRef-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php Script-Input.txt > Script-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php AssetHash-Input.txt > AssetHash-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php Genesis-Input.txt > Genesis-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php Transfer-Input.txt > Transfer-Output-PHP.txt
php ../php/coinspark-test.php MessageHash-Input.txt > MessageHash-Output-PHP.txt

* Now check the corresponding PHP and C output files for differences

diff Address-Output-C.txt Address-Output-PHP.txt
diff AssetRef-Output-C.txt AssetRef-Output-PHP.txt
diff Script-Output-C.txt Script-Output-PHP.txt
diff AssetHash-Output-C.txt AssetHash-Output-PHP.txt
diff Genesis-Output-C.txt Genesis-Output-PHP.txt
diff Transfer-Output-C.txt Transfer-Output-PHP.txt
diff MessageHash-Output-C.txt MessageHash-Output-PHP.txt

* If no differences were reported, the library has passed the C-PHP consistency test.

* Feel free to look inside the input and output files to see what is going on.

* Python tests run similarly to PHP. First, create Python outputs:

python ../python/coinspark-test.py Address-Input.txt > Address-Output-Python.txt
python ../python/coinspark-test.py AssetRef-Input.txt > AssetRef-Output-Python.txt
python ../python/coinspark-test.py Script-Input.txt > Script-Output-Python.txt
python ../python/coinspark-test.py AssetHash-Input.txt > AssetHash-Output-Python.txt
python ../python/coinspark-test.py Genesis-Input.txt > Genesis-Output-Python.txt
python ../python/coinspark-test.py Transfer-Input.txt > Transfer-Output-Python.txt

* Now check the corresponding Python and C output files for differencess

diff Address-Output-C.txt Address-Output-Python.txt
diff AssetRef-Output-C.txt AssetRef-Output-Python.txt
diff Script-Output-C.txt Script-Output-Python.txt
diff AssetHash-Output-C.txt AssetHash-Output-Python.txt
diff Genesis-Output-C.txt Genesis-Output-Python.txt
diff Transfer-Output-C.txt Transfer-Output-Python.txt

* If no differences were reported, the library has passed the C-Python consistency test.

* Java tests begin by compiling the Java classes:

javac ../java/src/main/java/org/coinspark/protocol/*.java

* Now run the CoinSparkTest class and keep pressing return to accept all the default options:

java -classpath ../java/src/main/java/ org.coinspark.protocol.CoinSparkTest

* Now check the corresponding Java and C output files for differencess

diff Address-Output-C.txt Address-Output-Java.txt
diff AssetRef-Output-C.txt AssetRef-Output-Java.txt
diff Script-Output-C.txt Script-Output-Java.txt
diff AssetHash-Output-C.txt AssetHash-Output-Java.txt
diff Genesis-Output-C.txt Genesis-Output-Java.txt
diff Transfer-Output-C.txt Transfer-Output-Java.txt

* If no differences were reported, the library has passed the C-Java consistency test.

* Remove compiled classes

rm ../java/src/main/java/org/coinspark/protocol/*.class

* For the Javascript tests, you will need to open javascript/coinspark-test.html
in your web browser. Then for each '...-Input.txt' file generated by C, paste
the contents of that file into the left-hand field of the web page, then click
the arrow button at the top. Once Javascript has finished executing, the content
in the right-hand side of the page can be compared against the appropriate
'...-Output-C.txt' file, and should be identical.
